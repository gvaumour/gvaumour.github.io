>  Post-Doc at Uppsala University (Sweden)

Bio: 

I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Bordeaux in 2016. I worked with Pr. [Denis Barthou[9]] in the [CEA LIST[13]] and in [INRIA Bordeaux[10]]. My PhD thesis was on heterogeneous memory management on embedded multi-core processors and has been defended the 4 October 2016 against the opponents: William Jalby, Albert Cohen, Olivier Sentieys and Alexandra Jimborean

I now work a post-doc researcher in computer architecture in the Dept. of Information Technology at Uppsala University. I have been working with [David Black-Schaffer[11]] and [Alexandra Jimborean[12]] on studying the opportunity of the new non-volatile memories technologies (NVM) for cache-based memory systems both in hardware and software point of views.

In addition to research, I have been involved in the organization of the [MCC workshop[8]] and the [ACM-W Uppsala Chapter[14]].

Topic of Research 
-----------------

* Emerging non-volatile memory technologies
* Memory Systems : Cache Management Techniques for Energy Consumption Reduction and Cache Coherence Optimizations
